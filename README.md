# solboard
English Peg Solitaire implementation of full board computation and small ncurses game.

This is a implementation of the brute force calculation of the winning board of the solitaire peg board.

To demonstrate the results a small ncurse game has been implemented.
It's playable with arrows and enter key to grab a pawn.
Color of the game switch in red when player doesn't have any chance to win.

Before launching the game, you must generate the winning board files for the game with a executable named generate-boards-files in the main directory.

As I explained in the story file, it's a very very old project that I discover in my archieves during the COVID19 in France.

I'm happy to finish it at least and be able to share it.

Regards,

Vincent
