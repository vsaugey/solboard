To build the project ensure you have a proper C compilator and cmake installed.
The libncurses-dep package must also be installed to compile the game.

After these check, in the directory you extract files :

#cmake .

That will create makefile for your distribution or system, and :

#make

That will compile the executable.

Before launch the game "solboard" please launch generate-board-files executable
